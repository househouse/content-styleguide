## Writing conventions

- Canadian spelling. (e.g. “colour,” “behaviour,” etc.)
- Punctuation marks should appear inside closing quotes. (e.g. “What a world!”)
- Surround em dashes (—) with a [thin space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space); not a full space or no space at all. (e.g. “Hey — eek!”)
- No ampersands unless part of a title; use “and” instead. (e.g. “strength and honour”)
- Sentences finishing with abbreviated words do not need second period. (e.g. “stuff, thing, etc.”)
- Multiplication symbol (“×”) instead of a standard “x.” (e.g. “`12px` × `40px`”)
- Double-quote instead of single-quote for referring to another element. (e.g. “this.”)
- Filenames as their extensions. (e.g. “.jpg,” “.pdf,” “.sketch,” etc.)
- Prefer the active tense instead of their gerund, where appropriate. (e.g. "Develop" not "Developing", "Developed" not "Was developing".)
- Use the oxford comma. (e.g. "Lions, tigers, and bears" not "Lions, tigers and bears".)
