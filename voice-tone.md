# Content and Language Guide: Voice & Tone

What is voice and tone? MailChimp describes it as:
> What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.


## What is our voice?

Our voice at House House is familiar and pleasant. You know there is a real person behind it. It’s honest, it’s  trustworthy, it’s friendly. One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. That said, we are:

- direct but not dominating
- pleasant but not silly
- confident but not arrogant
- smart but not stodgy
- short but not choppy
- formal but not stiff
- helpful but not overbearing
- expert but not bossy
- weighty but not patronizing
- personable but not unprofessional


## What is our tone?

Our tone might lean a bit more to the informal side, but we’re never silly or frivolous. We always aim for clarity, but we want to make sure the reader is entertained and amused — when appropriate. Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.
